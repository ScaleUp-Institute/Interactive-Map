As a direct continuation of the I4G programme with a much larger national reach, the three-month programme offers tailored scaleup support for businesses in the arts and culture sector across England and Scotland. It is funded by Arts Council England and has been designed and delivered by the British Library Business & Intellectual Property Centre (BIPC) and a number of private sector partners. The programme has tapped into the British Library’s BIPC National Network, consisting of 22 Business & IP Centres across the UK and a further 86 satellite services delivered through town libraries.

Get Ready for Business Growth has adopted I4G’s course structure and leverages its existing network of delivery partners along with two key learnings: the importance of assigned Relationship Managers and an emphasis on the British Library’s collections and customised business research. The overall programme consists of three streams; Get Ready for Business Growth: Scale-ups, Get Ready for Business Growth: Mentoring and Get Ready for Business Growth: Start-ups and is delivered completely virtually.

The programme, which is delivered to cohorts of c. 25 creative business leaders, consists of 8 workshops and 8 one to one bespoke sessions totalling 32 hours of support. The one to one sessions cover support in strategy development, fundraisings, testing and launching new products, protecting their IP, research competitors and many more. Each participant is paired with a Relationship Manager who oversees their engagement, acts as a counsellor and refers them to relevant services support. Additionally, they receive a personalised research report drawing on the Library’s world-leading collections and are trained in the use of the BIPC’s extensive market research resources.

Get Ready for Business Growth graduates benefit from access to the ‘Growth Club’, an existing community of over 700 leaders, first established as part of I4G; and ongoing engagement with their relationship manager enables their progress to be tracked and the measurement of business outcomes, while also providing ongoing support.

In its first year, the programme reported positive impact outperforming I4G’s first year in terms of number of scaleup businesses supported, jobs created and new products, processes and services generated, as well as the number of mentors trained. So far, the ‘Get Ready for Business Growth: Scale-ups’ stream has helped 98 creative scaling businesses, with so far 23% of them creating 56 new jobs. As a result of the programme’s learnings, participants have created and implemented 68 new products, processes and services in the first three quarters. 40 graduate mentors were trained with accreditation from the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM) and all participants have been signposted to continuing accelerators and business hubs as part of offboarding from the programme.

Its Scale Up Accelerator empowers leaders of high-growth engineering and tech businesses by equipping them with the leadership skills and insights needed to scale up successfully.

The programme offers a tailored 12-month package of leadership training, coaching and business mentoring, backed by a £10k grant to fund training of participants’ choosing. Each cohort of 15 scaling leaders is also connected with mentors from the Academy’s network 1,700+ fellows.

Mentors have industry and tech businesses scaling experience, so they can support with technology and business needs. This sits alongside expert-led workshops, speaker events, fireside chats and investor referrals. The range of support offered allows participants to create a bespoke package tailored to their scaling priorities and ambitions.

Upon graduation participants are given lifetime membership of the Academy’s Enterprise Hub, with access to its co-working spaces in London and Belfast and a new hub Glasgow, which opened in 2023. Additionally the Academy has developed a new exclusive alumni programme <span style=""color: #ff9900;""><a style=""color: #ff9900;"" href=""https://enterprisehub.raeng.org.uk/explore"">EXPLORE</a></span> to help previous programme participants to tap into overseas  markets and ecosystems and access investors; it also facilitates peer-to-peer networking events, connections, and ongoing mentoring opportunities for alumni.

Other new developments in the past year include increasing the number of participants per cohort and extending programme duration to 12 months, giving scaling leaders an additional six months to access support. A new Culture+ platform – developed in partnership with The Honeycomb Works – is a dedicated equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) resource for scaling companies, giving access to training, policy templates, checklists, case studies, and opportunities for self and peer reflection.

Since 2016, 143 scaleup leaders have participated in the programme, more than 3,000 new jobs have been created and company valuations have increased by £1.76bn. On average, participants increased their employment by more than 50 per cent after 12 months of support and received £976m in investment and £133m in grant funding since the programme started.

The syndicate currently has around 120 members invested in a portfolio of 20 early-stage companies. The preferred level of investment is £250k to £2m and typically co-ordinates the investment of more than £15m per year. While the capital provided by Archangels is not primarily scaleup capital, it provides businesses with patient money to help them on their scaling journey.

The syndicate typically co-ordinates the investment of more than £10m per year in early stage Scottish tech and life science companies. Archangels invested £13.4m during 2022; the total investment among 11 businesses was a 14% increase on Archangels’ investment activity in 2021 (£11.8m).

Archangels regularly invests alongside co-investment partners including Scottish Enterprise, other angel syndicates and VCs. In 2023, the syndicate secured a £12m <a href=""https://archangelsonline.com/archangels-coinvestment-12m-british-business-investments-bbi/"">co-investment agreement with British Business Investments</a> via its Regional Angels Programme.

Companies must fit the investment criteria of being based in Scotland; a technology or life science business with a B2B business model; having high growth potential with international sales potential; defendable technology; and qualify under the Enterprise Investment Scheme.

SCF has increasingly participated in Archangels’ deals with a relatively steady proportion of total investment at around 25-30%. Archangels uses this stable relationship to increase leverage, particularly in later rounds. SCF’s participation offers Archangels’ portfolio companies further support including mentoring and other practical support from the public sector.

As well as financial investment, members contribute their time and expertise to support company growth including providing connections to relevant industry experience and contacts. Archangels has pushed its learnings into the wider angel community and beyond into the policy domain in order to facilitate improved performance and impacts economically. The open innovation approach taken by Archangels from an early stage has helped facilitate the wider growth of angel investing in Scotland.

Launched in 2013, Sharing in Growth’s (SiG) aim is to support scaling businesses in the UK’s manufacturing and engineering supply chains to improve their productivity and competitiveness and be better placed to win a share of global markets. Over the last 10 years SiG has collaborated with over 100 companies across a range of industries, initially focused on aerospace it now supports diverse busineses including  defence, offshore renewables, medical (NHS), Modular Methods of Construction (MMC), and nuclear sectors.

Supported by a team of 100 business coaches, scaling firms with turnover between £5m-£100m, are offered long-term, intensive and holistic leadership and management support. Over four years, a typical beneficiary receives around £1m worth of training and development. There is no upfront funding commitment, however businesses are asked to match the value of support in-kind.

The programme is delivered over three phases: first, a whole firm diagnostics assessment; second a “develop” phase of high intensity training over two years; and finally, a “sustain” phase over 2-3 years to ensure that support is embedded. Throughout this period, alongside assistance from their business coach, scaling businesses receive support from a network of 19 specialist partners including the University of Cambridge’s Institute for Manufacturing, Deloitte, Multiverse and the National Physical Laboratory. Launched in 2022, SiG also provides an online learning platform to supplement onsite coaching and increase the speed and impact of business transformation. It covers 10 key areas including operational excellence, lean leadership behaviours, quality, and supply chain management.

The last few years’ complex economic challenges due to Covid-19 and the transition to new trading arrangements with Europe and beyond has made the key programme deliverables of accelerating productivity, diversifying and winning new customers vital. The programme’s independent assessment, published in 2021 by BEIS, showed significant impact and specifically on employment and turnover. Scaling businesses completing the programme, showed 30% more average turnover growth than the control group companies. Additionally, participants reported a positive impact of SiG on leadership attitudes and behaviours and business strategy. This resulted in improvements in wider workforce engagement, confidence and behaviour to implement changes within businesses.

It is focused on creating new discoveries, therapeutics, jobs and growth to support the UK economy. It aims to be a leading sustainable ecosystem and one of the best places in the world for discovery bioscience research and innovation. It brings together world leading bioscience research and business to accelerate scientific discovery and to help build and scale businesses. 

Scaleups are part of a supportive campus infrastructure and have access to laboratories and offices via short-term leases, giving them the opportunity to grow into larger spaces when they evolve. The Accelerate@Babraham bioincubator programme provides additional support for early-stage life science scaleups and is recognised by Labiotech as one of the top 25 such incubators in Europe. The five-month programme includes tailored scientific, business, and technical support, free lab space, access to the Cambridge Cluster network, investor introductions and access to £10k of non-diluted funding. To join the programme, companies undergo an annual competitive application and pitching process. Up to five early-stage ventures are selected  as part of each cohort to experience life as part of the Babraham Research Campus.

Additionally for scaleups seeking investment, the annual Babraham Investor Conference, last held in September 2023, provides a collaborative and information environment that brings together hundreds of investors, companies and industry leaders in order to facilitate access to venture capital investment. 

In October 2023, the Campus announced that, in partnership with BioMed Realty, it will be opening a new 34,000 square feet purpose-built facility in order to address the growing demand for lab space in Cambridge. Key tenants moving into expansive scale-up labs within the new building, scheduled to open in early 2024, include scaling businesses Xap Therapeutics and Mosaic Therapeutics.

In a 2020 review of the Campus’ economic impact, Campus-based companies estimated that they had on average accelerated their fundraising by three months and increased the amount of funds raised by 10%.  It is also estimated that employee numbers of resident firms are around 20% larger than they otherwise may have been due to the Campus location. The total market value of the largest 14 companies on site was calculated to be £5bn. ",,,,,England,England,CB22 3AT,United Kingdom,"52.13268,0.20544"

Its successful model has now been replicated across the globe, including Africa, East Asia and the Pacific regions.

Since its launch in 2016, the Regulatory Sandbox has operated on a cohort basis, but in August 2021, it moved to an always open model, allowing firms to submit their applications throughout the year, an approach also encouraged by the Kalifa Review of UK Fintech. Firms can now access testing services at any point throughout the year, at the point and time that is right in their development lifecycle. 

Under this new model, 22 firms have been accepted onto the programme, with their propositions operating across the retail lending, retail investments, retail banking, payments and wholesale sectors. The main types of innovation have continued to be dominated by data and technology infrastructure, with firms using AI/machine learning and predictive analytics, distributed ledger technology (DLT) / blockchain technology, open banking, APIs and digital ID. 

This year, following the successes of two Digital Sandbox pilots, the FCA launched the permanent FCA Digital Sandbox. The evaluation reports from the pilots have concluded that the Digital Sandbox initiative addresses the needs of early-stage and scaling firms, especially in the networking and collaboration. Almost 6 in 10 of the scaling participants have reported positive progress which has included securing  funding and partnership, launching products or receiving industry rewards and recognitions. Innovators across all financial service sectors can join the programme and to date, 58 participants are included across 9 themes: Consumer Investments Advice & Distribution; Cross-sectors & Other; Fund & Investment Management; Infrastructure & Exchange; Insurance; Payments; Retail Banking; Retail Lending; and Wholesale Banks & Intermediaries.

In 2022, FCA also launched the ‘Innovation Pathways’ programme, a bespoke support service for firms that are not yet ready to test but need help understanding the FCA regulatory regime prior to doing so. The programme helps businesses understand the process; regulation rules, the implications for their business model, and what they need to do to launch a regulated business. To achieve this, dedicated case managers, customised signposting, discussions and feedback with FCA subject matter experts, informal steers, pre-authorisation meetings, an assigned Authorisations case handler and dedicated supervisory support are available to support them. 

FCA also serves as chair for the Global Financial Innovation Network (GFIN), launched in 2019, bringing together over 70 international organisations committed to supporting financial innovation in the interests of consumers. Members include the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the USA’s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission.

Closely  connected with ecosystems in London and Cambridge, it aims to support a globally recognised and vibrant hub that brings together academics, biotech and pharma organisations in a spirit of collaboration and partnership.  In 2023, Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst, in collaboration with Forge, announced that it will expand to become one of Europe’s largest Life Science campuses. The development includes the largest cluster of cell and gene therapy companies outside of the USA.

The campus supports resident companies to grow and scale at pace. Lab and office space is provided along with scientific and business expertise. This includes access to peer networks, mentoring, funding, expertise, scientific equipment and facilities to enable businesses to scale and innovate.

Scaleups are supported to overcome key challenges including access to talent, markets and finance and have access to specialist facilities and equipment, including a dedicated Catapult onsite training lab. The ‘DATA accelerator’ programme fosters leadership, equips scaleup leaders with business and commercial skills and connects scaleups with investors. In the most recent cohort, each scaleup in the accelerator programme was connected to 38 industry leading experts and, on average, the participating scaleups followed up with private conversations with up to four experts. In addition, SBC’s dedicated Entrepreneurship and Business Development Director facilitates introductions to grant funding, investors and venture capitalists.  

Flexible infrastructure is key to SBC’s offer. Campus-based Lab Hotel offers laboratory space to eight scaleups a year. Around 70% of the companies that have been through the Lab Hotel have then continued to take lab space at SBC. Around 45 companies have access to the Cytiva tech lab and the campus’ New Spark building creates space for 100 jobs.

Its newly announced Life Sciences hub – the Elevate Quarter - will run alongside GSK’s existing global R&D facility and the wider SBC ecosystem. A partnership between UBS Asset Management and Reef Group, the new 1.6 million square foot campus will include office and lab space as well as Good Manufacturing Practices facilities and will create up to 5,000 new jobs. Construction is scheduled to start later this year. 

Since opening in 2012, SBC has hosted a total of 92 scaling companies, 65 with occupational leases and a further 27 with virtual leases, while 3 companies have established offices in the US. In 2023, 884 jobs were created by SBC companies which also expect to increase employment by an average of 50% in the next 18 months. Companies  also reported that being based at SBC meant that product development was on average nine months faster and research accelerated by six months.

There remains a strong focus on the talent pipeline and there are around 13 active apprenticeships in addition to 12 with GSK.

Customised engagement is designed to help them to scale and compete globally while remaining domiciled in Canada. Cohorts of the most promising companies are selected from a diverse range of sectors including AI, medtech, fintech, agritech, tech-enabled retailers and oil and gas. Support is extended to the wider executive teams of scaleups rather than focusing solely on founders; this includes access to function-oriented peer groups.

Lazaridis runs all-cohort events to further expand trusted peer networks with speakers drawn from globally successful companies. The ScaleUp programme has been delivered on a hybrid model since the pandemic, allowing to complement and enrich in-person events with the best of virtual learning practices. In 2023, the current cohort participants were brought to Palo Alto and New York, in both cities, scaleups took advantage of the visit to book time with customers, partners, and potential investors.

Since its launch in 2016, Lazaridis has supported 829 executives and 83 scaling companies that have raised more than CA$2.2bn in new funding and created 4,285 jobs. Now on its eighth cohort, the programme has a strong impact on scaleups. Scaleups show an average annualised growth rate of 53% in employment and 114% in revenues, while all participating scaleups reported increased confidence or leadership capacity. Additionally, 89 per cent of the participating scaleups have now  identified new markets, , 67 per cent have now started exporting, and 78 per cent have accessed new markets including Europe, Asia, Middle East, UAE and USA.

In October 2022, Lazaridis also hosted its first in-person all-cohort event since 2019. Supported by serial entrepreneur Marnie Walker, the event gave more than 50 scaleups the opportunity to share experiences and learn from Lazaridis mentors and industry luminaries.

The programme’s commitment to diversity is a key priority with 46 percent of founders being from an under-represented group. Cleantech and greentech companies and social enterprises represent 20 percent of Lazaridis scaleups.
<blockquote>“One of the most valuable aspects of Lazaridis ScaleUp is the network that you create with your peers. Everyone is an absolute rock star!”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“I find the opportunity to interact with our cohort colleagues to be the most valuable part of the Lazaridis program. I had good conversations with several peers and gained insights and ideas about what we can implement in our company.”</blockquote>

Match-Maker Ventures,15443,https://www.match-maker.ventures/,Finance,Fintech,,Provider type>Private sector,,Match-Maker Ventures,,,International,ScaleUp Institute Endorsed/One to Watch,1,Support to enter international markets,Delivered for a fee,Product,,,2015,,,https://v2-scaleup-institute.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MMV-2.png,Support Offer,,Access to markets,"Match-Maker Ventures (MMV) aims to build a world where business collaboration has no borders.  To achieve this, MMV matches growing businesses with established telecom corporations, accelerating the process of collaboration.

MMV’s approach is powered by robust networks and deep telecom industry knowledge. It leverages its network members who have executive experience in the telecom industry – called “Match-Makers” – to match scaling businesses with large corporates, managing the collaboration process from end to end. In the last year, MMV shifted its portfolio focus further on to scaleups to promote significant collaborations with corporate customers and continue to grow. Its ‘Lead Identification and Account Management’ function uses sophisticated analytical tools to identify business opportunities for its scaleup portfolio. To date these tools have mapped over 150,000 connections and MMV further increases scaleups’ visibility using its marketing channels. 

To manage the fact that selling to large corporates is not a direct process, participating companies are offered a phased programme. Scaling businesses are initially offered a market strategy and sales preparation that examines their business model, agrees on a sales approach and identifies the profile of the right target customer. They are also assigned a solution manager to support the joint activities. In the second phase, the network of Match-Makers then approaches priority companies, future partners, customers and resellers, to open doors and offer hands-on support to the company’s sales activities, from first discussions all the way to contract signature and scaling of the joint activities. 

MMV’s global network has a global footprint and is continuing to broaden its network especially in the telecom industry. It is also continuing to develop its presence in key strategic growth areas in Latin America and the Middle East. 

In 2022 MMV hosted 15+ deep dive sessions to support its portfolio of scaleups alongside their Deep Dive Festival aiming to facilitate business opportunities by giving scaleups the platform to share their value propositions and key business insights with industry experts to augment and accelerate business impact.",|,|,|,Vienna|,Vienna|,Vienna|,,Austria|Austria,AT|AT
